# The Phonebook Application

My solutions to the exercises in Part 3 of the [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) MOOC from the University of Helsinki. These solutions take the form of a full-stack phonebook application, deployed [here](https://fso-phonebook-xq4b.onrender.com/).

My solutions to Parts 0, 1 and 2 of the course (including the frontend code for the phonebook project) can be found [here](https://github.com/tusktenon/full-stack-open).
